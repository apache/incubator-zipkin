[Zipkin](http://twitter.github.com/zipkin) is a distributed tracing system that helps us gather timing data for all the disparate services at Twitter.

## Full documentation
See [http://twitter.github.com/zipkin](http://twitter.github.com/zipkin)

## Quick start
You'll need Scala 2.9.1

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/twitter/zipkin`, or [download a release](https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/downloads)

To run a collector daemon: `bin/collector`

To run a query daemon: `bin/query`

To run a UI daemon: `bin/ui`

## Contributions
Contributions are very welcome! Please create a pull request on github and we'll look at it as soon as possible.

Try to make the code in the pull request as focused and clean as possible, stick as close to our code style as you can.

If the pull request is becoming too big we ask that you split it into smaller ones.

Areas where we'd love to see contributions include: adding tracing to more libraries and protocols, interesting reports generated with Hadoop from the trace data, extending collector to support more transports and storage systems and other ways of visualizing the data in the web UI.

## Versioning
We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) style versioning.
