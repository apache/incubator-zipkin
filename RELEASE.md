# Zipkin Release Process

This repo uses semantic versions with a twist: we update minors on api-breaks until we hit 1.0. Please keep this
in mind when choosing version numbers.

1. **Alert others you are releasing**

   There should be no commits made to master while the release is in progress (about 10 minutes). Before you start
   a release, alert others on [gitter](https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin) so that they don't accidentally merge
   anything. If they do, and the build fails because of that, you'll have to recreate the release tag described below.

1. **Push a git tag**

   The tag should be of the format `release-N.M.L`, for example `release-0.18.1`.

1. **Wait for Travis CI**

   This part is controlled by [`travis/publish.sh`](travis/publish.sh). It creates a bunch of new commits, bumps
   the version, publishes artifacts, syncs to Maven Central, and publishes Javaocs to http://zipkin.io/zipkin
   into a versioned subdirectory.
   (Note: Javaocs are also published on all builds of master; due to versioning, it doesn't overwrite docs built
   for releases.)

1. **Publish `docker-zipkin`**

   Refer to [docker-zipkin/RELEASE.md](https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-zipkin/blob/master/RELEASE.md).
   
## Credentials

Credentials of various kind are needed for the release process to work. If you notice something
failing due to unauthorized, re-encrypt them using instructions at the bottom of the `.travis.yml`

Ex You'll see comments like this:
```yaml
env:
  global:
  # Ex. travis encrypt BINTRAY_USER=your_github_account
  - secure: "VeTO...
```

To re-encrypt, you literally run the commands with relevant values and replace the "secure" key with the output:

```bash
$ travis encrypt BINTRAY_USER=adrianmole
Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:

  secure: "mQnECL+dXc5l9wCYl/wUz+AaYFGt/1G31NAZcTLf2RbhKo8mUenc4hZNjHCEv+4ZvfYLd/NoTNMhTCxmtBMz1q4CahPKLWCZLoRD1ExeXwRymJPIhxZUPzx9yHPHc5dmgrSYOCJLJKJmHiOl9/bJi123456="
```
